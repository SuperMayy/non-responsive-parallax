        <h2>BALLING TILL I DIE</h2>
        <p><b>What does it mean to call a certain sport “the best”?<b> In this instance,
          it involves discussing inherent aspects of a certain game that make it more
          enjoyable to any given athlete, as compared to another sport.
<br>It’s extremely difficult to tell people why their opinion is wrong, when all
claims are founded on preferences, but that’s exactly what we sports editors are
 setting out to do with one another. Here’s why a game that supposedly began as
 offseason training for football is objectively the best sport.</p>

          <h2>HISTORY AND SKILL</h2>
          <p>Basketball, which was first played in 1891 with peach baskets and no
             dribbling, combines the ideal amount of necessary raw physical
             attributes—height, strength, speed, agility, power, etc.—with the
             necessary skills—shooting, dribbling, passing, etc. So many areas of
             the game involve utilizing strength and power, such as rebounding,
             scoring in the post, and protecting the paint, while others involve
             extreme finesse and acquired skill, such as ball handling, jump shooting,
             and passing. Overall, basketball has the widest range of physicality and
             contact level in all respects.</p>
